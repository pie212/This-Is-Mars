# This-Is-Mars
Small Batch RPG type game where you need to survive on mars.


Hello! 
Thank you for installing my game.

To run game:

Download the zip with all the files in it. Extract the zip and move the "This Is Mars" to "C:\", the file directory should then be "C:\This Is Mars", if the directory is like that the exe will not work. You can drag the "This Is Mars.EXE" to wherever you would like. If you want to edit anything right open the "mars game" folder and right click marsgame.bat (all the code is there) and click edit. Once you open the zip there will be about 20 or so files. Do not touch them unless you know what you are doing. Only touch start.bat to start the game.

Bugs:
CMD gets weirded out if there is no other option for certain questions. For example some questions have specific answers like "Bob" which can be used select certain items. If "Enter" is pressed it may cause CMD to crash since it is a response that the script is not forseen to handle.  

Important:
Since sound files arent using mp3 formats if you close cmd before the sound stops it will continue playing. To close the sound file go to task manager --> more details --> wscript.exe Microsoft Â® Windows Based Script Host (may also be under the dropdown of CMD) and then click "end task"





Know Bugs:

- when fixing something and nothing is broken, if 1,2,3 is pressed even when there is nothing broken... it will still take supplies so just press 

Enjoy the game, please post bugs in the "Issues" tab on github so I can fix them.
